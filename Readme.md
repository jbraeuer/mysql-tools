This repository holds "mysql-tools". These tools offer the following function

- create database dump via `mysqldump`
- restore a backup, create database and user if needed
- obfuscate a dump

These scripts come handy to create backup on production and
obfuscate/anonymize dumps for test systems. Also devs can self-serve
with the provided 'restore' function.
